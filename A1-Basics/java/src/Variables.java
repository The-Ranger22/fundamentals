        Data types are separated between two categories, primitive (int, char, double, etc.) and non-primitive (Arrays,
        classes, and interfaces). Primitive data types that are just that, primitive. They are 'simple', the bare bone
        blocks that all other code is built upon. Whats cool about that is the realization that no matter how complex a
        class might seem, underneath it all is the same familiar primitive data types you've come to know.
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        Primitive Data types (eight in total)                   Non-Primitive Data Types (No limit)
        -int (whole numbers, negative or positive)              -Integer
        -char ('a' 'b' 'c')                                     -String
        -double (decimal numbers, ex. 1.2)                      -Scanner
        -boolean (Binary true or false)                         -Etc.
        -short
        -byte
        -long
        -float
